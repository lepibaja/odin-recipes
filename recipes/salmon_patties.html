  <h2>These salmon patties are delicious for lunch or dinner. </h2>
  <p>his recipe is so easy and quick to make. My nine year old daughter even likes this. She did like it better when I made it with cracker crumbs rather than bread crumbs. If you're not a fish person, I'd suggest you buy the salmon that comes in tuna-sized 3 oz can. </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
  <ul>
    <li>1 (14.75 ounce) can canned salmon </li>
    <li>1 egg </li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped onion </li>
    <li>½ cup seasoned dry bread crumbs </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Drain and reserve liquid from salmon. Mix egg, onion, bread crumbs and salmon together.</li>
    <li>Make into patties. If mixture is too dry to form into patties, add reserved liquid from salmon.</li>
    <li>In a frying pan, heat olive oil. Place patties in pan. Brown on each side, turning gently. Drain on paper towels and serve.</li>
  </ol>
