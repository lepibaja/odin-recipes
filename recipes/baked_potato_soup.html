  <h2>Thick and creamy. Uses leftover baked potatoes.</h2>
  <p>ERY good soup. I recommend being careful how much flour you put in, though. I put too much in. The thickness comes at the final stages, so don't worry if it seems thin. Also, I like it with more potato and bacon in it like a chowder.I will definately be making this during the winter.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>12 slices bacon </li>
    <li>⅔ cup margarine </li>
    <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour </li>
    <li>7 cups milk </li>
    <li>4 large baked potatoes, peeled and cubed </li>
    <li>4 green onions, chopped </li>
    <li>1 ¼ cups shredded Cheddar cheese </li>
    <li>1 cup sour cream </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium heat until browned. Drain, crumble, and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a stock pot or Dutch oven, melt the margarine over medium heat. Whisk in flour until smooth. Gradually stir in milk, whisking constantly until thickened. Stir in potatoes and onions. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes. Mix in bacon, cheese, sour cream, salt, and pepper. Continue cooking, stirring frequently, until cheese is melted.</li>
